"Update to previous post https://lnkd.in/g7GjK-pC: I immediately took down my class project site after receiving yesterday’s ultimatum. I still don’t think the simple demo site violated the letter or spirit of the registration rules, but I took it down because I always want to operate in good faith.

They followed up today to thank me for doing it, but also indicated that they were putting a hold on my account anyway. As a result, I am not going to be able to register for my final quarter and have been de facto expelled at the end of this quarter.

Unless, that is, I agree to work on a comparable solution for the university focused on solving the underlying problem I was building HuskySwap for. They would presumably own the IP and were clear that I wouldn’t be compensated. But it was implied that they would then remove the hold, allowing me to graduate.

I really love UW and have had a wonderful time here. But this is so demoralizing."
"This story is insane.

JD Kaim essentially coded the equivalent of GT scheduler (with the added functionality of trading classes with other students). In response, UW placed an indefinite registration hold on his account, de facto expelling him.

UW then implied this would be removed if he developed this solution for the university for free, and added language to the code of conduct to impeach his use of university systems.

I am sure many of you have experienced the frustration of trying to find a solution to a problem within the bounds of a biased system. Private universities cannot do whatever they want by nature of being private. Please show JD some love and go support his post."
"For anyone who wants to try our tool out. It's live at https://www.bd-qr.com :)

I've also attached a demo video. If any of you try it out and have feedback let me know, and I will add it to the list of items to develop out as we build out our tool :)"
"Bubble Date had its first viral reel! 🥳🥳🥳

Our most recent Instagram Reels post hit over 400k views and 10k likes, making it the most liked piece of content in Bubble Date's history. Here's hoping the trend continues! 📈📈🆙

Here's what I learned: 🤔💭

1) Stay consistent. Posting a reel a day can greatly improve your chances of going viral. Even if you're up to date on the most recent trends, it can take a stroke of luck to hit your niche just right. 🎥🎞️

2) Virality is subjective. The same video that got 140k views in IG got only 1k views and 50 likes on Tiktok. You can make good content and still fall short of your desired reach. 😔💔

3) Don't give up! Establishing a social media presence is important. If I go to a company's social page and they haven't posted in a while, I assume the project is abandoned. Even if you get low engagement, showing users someone is engaged with the mission and cares is a big step in building brand trust. ✍️📝

4) Last but not least, if you make a video be sure to post it on Tiktok, Reels, and YT Shorts. You're leaving engagement on the table if you don't. You already made the content, so just repost it! Credit to Tan Cao for this vital tip. 👏👏👏

Ready for a new semester and many more videos!"
"Who are you? Why are you emailing me like a pirate? Is there any way to turn this off? 🤓🤓🤓 

Yarrrrr... ⛵🦜🏴‍☠️

If landlubbers are getting you down this internship season, why not try piratify.ai? Respond to internship rejections on the high seas- those recruiters won't be knowing their aft from their bow by the time you're done with them! ⚔️🦀

This is a fun side project I took 30 minutes to code. It automatically responds to all your rejection emails like a pirate. There's not really a way to turn it off, so try it at your own peril! It'll respond to all rejection emails after 12/1/24. ⚠️⚠️⚠️

"Ever wondered what a cofounder working on Bubble Date does? 🤔

Ran into Alfredo Tovar Jr on GT’s campus and he happened to be shooting a video, so watch my response below 👇👇👇

Since this video was shot I’ve been cold calling businesses and working on leads using monday.com and I’ve secured a few new local businesses we’re partnering with 🤝

Stay tuned for more! 😼"
"People ask me all the time what it takes to be Founder Mode as Gen Z at Bubble Date and I’ve never been able to put it into words… 🤔🤔🤔

The best founders just have something different about them ✅

Watch this video of my CTO to get a feeling for that X factor. 🚞🏄‍♂️

"Bubble Date just threw a 700 person launch party drawing from 12 schools across Atlanta! I definitely need some rest after three weeks of planning and execution with Harsha Gaddipati and Sugju Choi 🍋. 

We generated our first revenue and learned a lot of lessons. Our takeaway is that events like this are a key part of our mission to make dating more authentic and organic.

Fetii and Red Bull helped make the event a success!

"Our launch party was a BLAST!! We just wrapped up our first ever Bubble Date in-person event, bringing together 686 students from 12 different schools in Atlanta!\xa0🎉

After 3 weeks of intense planning with Michael Klikushin, Harsha Gaddipati, and Steven Nguyen, seeing our first paid event come to life was so rewarding. Nothing beats meeting our users face-to-face and watching them enjoy the experience we created. 

Special thanks to our partners Fetii and Red Bull for helping make this night unforgettable.

"Bubble Date  won the popular vote at the Atlanta Tech Village's It Takes a Village Program 14th cohort graduation for best pitch! Sugju Choi 🍋 did a great job presenting.🏆

It's been a great 16 weeks learning from the best, thanks to everyone who offered a word of advice or connection when I had questions! Networking, marketing, customer acquisition and retention... the list goes on. 📝

We'll still be around for a while yet, since our prize was a free membership to ATV's space. Meanwhile, we've been generating our first revenue and leaning from other similar startups' business models to monetize. Big shoutout to PeerPop for working with us so closely! 🙌"
